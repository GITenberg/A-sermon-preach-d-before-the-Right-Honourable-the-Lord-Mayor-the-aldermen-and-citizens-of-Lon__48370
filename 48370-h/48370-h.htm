<h2>1 KINGS, XXI. 9, 10.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hang"><em>Proclaim a Fast, and set <strong>Naboth</strong> on high among the People</em>:</p>

<p class="hang"><em>And set Two Men, Sons of <strong>Belial</strong>, before him, to bear
Witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the
King: and then carry him out and stone him, that he may die.</em></p>
</div>


<p>There is scarce any one Instance of the shedding innocent Blood
recorded in Holy Scripture which has not at some time or other been
apply'd to the Occasion of this Day's Solemnity, even that of our
blessed Saviour not excepted, whose Steps we have with one Voice
declar'd in the Service of the Church the blessed Martyr cheerfully to
have follow'd. [Note: <i>2d Collect for the day.</i>] But here indeed it
concerns us to tread warily. We can only affirm of the greatest Saints
and brightest Luminaries of the Church that they have made some faint
Approaches toward that great Exemplar, without <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>presuming to equal
either the Merits or the Sufferings of any meer Man to those of our
crucify'd Redeemer: in all other Parallels there is less Danger of
Excess, since most of 'em will be found, in many Circumstances, to fall
short of the Fact committed on this Day.</p>

<p>Now altho' in such a comparative way of arguing, where we single out
some remarkable Passage from the Records of past Ages, and adapt it,
as far as it will naturally bear, to some After-Occurrence that has
fall'n out nearer our own Times, it cannot be expected that both
the Cases should be in all Respects exactly the same, without the
least Variation, yet when we can point out some of the principal
and Master-Strokes of each of 'em which have a near Resemblance of
one another, when the Methods and Ways of Acting, the Motives and
Inducements to it, with other concurrent Circumstances, are the same;
this may be enough to justify the Choice of the Subject, and make it
serve at least as a fair Introduction to the Matter in Debate.</p>

<p>I mention this, because of one remarkable Disagreement, which you
must needs have been before-hand with me in observing, between the
Case of <em>Naboth</em>, and that of this Day's <em>Royal Sufferer</em>, who as he
had Liv'd the Ornament, so Died the <em>Martyr</em> of the <em>English</em> Church
and Monarchy: And that is, that in the former of 'em, <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>an innocent
Subject was Murder'd by a wicked King (or at least by his Instruments
and Agents, not without his Approbation and Consent, as appear'd by
his subsequent Behaviour, in seizing his Inheritance, as well as by
his own Confession, when he submitted to the Prophet's Charge, and
humbled himself for it) whereas in the latter, a just and pious King
was depriv'd at once of his Crown and Life by wicked and rebellious
Subjects. But there are other Resemblances between 'em, that will make
Amends for this Disparity. And therefore I shall proceed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I. To draw a Parallel between the two Cases, and shew what is
common to 'em both.</p>

<p>II. To consider the Nature and Consequences of the Fact
committed on this Day. And</p>

<p>III. I shall conclude with one or two Moral Reflections.</p>
</div>


<p class="section">I. I am to draw a Parallel between the two Cases, and show what
is common to 'em both. Here then we may observe, that the Persons
compar'd were both good Men: Both were Murder'd with a pretended Show
of Justice, and with Religious Solemnities: Both for the same Cause,
because they would not part with <em>the Inheritance of their Fathers</em>:
Neither of 'em <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>suffer'd singly; but the Enemies of each extended their
Malice to the whole Race of 'em.</p>

<p>First I say they were both good Men. That <em>Naboth</em> was so, we may very
fairly conjecture from his Behaviour in the Matter of the Vineyard;
and from the Severity of God's Wrath toward <em>Ahab</em> and his Family, for
unjustly putting him to Death. For altho' the Murder even of a wicked
Man, either by false Accusation, or secret Treachery, is a very heinous
and detestable Thing; (and that Life that is Forfeited to Justice by a
thousand real Crimes, yet if innocent <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quoad hoc</i>, and taken away by
wicked Subornation, on weak and insufficient Evidence, for that which
is not a Crime, or which was not committed, will derive a Sentence of
Blood-guiltiness, nay of the Shedding innocent Blood, on the Contrivers
and Actors in such an Execution;) yet we cannot suppose, that this is,
in so excessive a Degree, provoking, or that it entails the Divine
Vengeance on so many Generations, as when the Person Condemn'd is
eminent for Piety and Vertue.</p>

<p>If indeed we were to judge of Things by their first Appearance, the
Carriage of <em>Naboth</em> toward <em>Ahab</em>, in denying him his Vineyard, might
seem to have been very Churlish and Undutiful, especially when offer'd
a <em>better Vineyard</em> in Exchange for it, or an equivolent in <em>Mony</em>.
And the Kings condescending way of Address, when <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>he thus expresses
himself, <em>If it shall seem good to thee</em>, and <em>if it please thee</em>;
might be thought to have deserv'd a better Answer than, <em>I will not
give thee my Vineyard</em>.</p>

<p>But we must consider on the other Hand, that the Thing which the
King desir'd, was absolutely Unlawful, and expressly forbid by the
Command of God; the smallest Ceremony of whose Appointment could not
be dispens'd with. We may learn from <cite>Lev.</cite> 25. and <cite>Num.</cite> 36. how
straitly the <em>Jews</em> were enjoyn'd to look upon the Inheritance of their
Fathers as Sacred: The very numerical Lands and Possessions were to be
continually preserv'd in the respective Families to which they were
allotted, and the present Occupants had no Power of totally alienating
'em, but only till they could be redeem'd by one of their Kin, and not
so long as that, if a Year of <em>Jubilee</em> should first happen, when all
Things were to be restor'd as at the beginning: And even that temporary
Alienation was not to be made, but under the Pressure of extreme
Necessity, which it seems was not <em>Naboth</em>'s Case. So that he look'd
on the Proposal, as a Thing he could not with a safe Conscience comply
with, and therefore speaks, you see, with some Abhorrence of it, (tho'
not altogether so bluntly as <em>Ahab</em> repeated it to his Wife) <em>The Lord
forbid it me, that I shou'd give the Inheritance of my Fathers unto
thee</em>. From this I say, and the <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>other Consideration before-mention'd,
we may reasonably infer that <em>Naboth</em> was a Man of Uprightness and
Integrity; tho' the Scripture has distinguish'd him by no other Title,
but that of <em>Naboth the Jesraelite</em>.</p>

<p>But we have better Arguments than bare Conjectures and remote
Conclusions to induce us to believe that our <em>Martyr'd Sovereign</em> was
highly deserving of this Character, of which we have all the Proof and
Demonstration that 'tis possible for one Man to have of the Integrity
of another.</p>

<p>'Tis true, God alone is an infallible Judge and Discerner of the Heart;
<em>he</em> only beholds with an unerring Eye the Uprightness or Obliquity of
Human Thoughts and Intentions; and therefore none but he can absolutely
and decisively pronounce of any Person, that he is either Holy and
Sincere, or Wicked and Prophane.</p>

<p>But we Men must form our Judgment from the outward Actions, and
wheresoever we find a regular Conduct, where all the Duties to God and
Man, as far as we can observe, are exactly and punctually discharg'd,
where there are no visible Infractions of Divine or Human Laws, or none
but such as may be imputed to Human Frailty; we are to look upon a
Person so qualified as a Man of Probity and Vertue.</p>

<p>This is no more than is due in <em>common Justice</em>. But <em>Christian
Charity</em> will oblige us yet <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>farther, even where there are some
suspicious Appearances, if the Character of the Person be in other
Respects unblemish'd; to err (if we must err) on the better Side, and
make a favourable Construction.</p>

<p>This is Spoken at large, and not that there is any Occasion for this
last Supposal, with Regard to the Subject I am upon: There being
nothing in the Behaviour of that <em>excellent Prince</em>, that has so much
as an indirect Aspect, nothing I mean that can affect his general
Character.</p>

<p>When I affirm this I consider him chiefly as a private Christian,
for in his <em>Royal Capacity</em> indeed, as we find him represented, by
the designing Artifice of his malicious and restless Enemies, there
are faulty Appearances enough. And yet the very Persons, who thus
industriously blackned and defam'd him, and loaded him with so many
unjust Reproaches on the Account of his <em>Regal Administration</em>; (which
can never be so Excellent, as to give no Handle to the <em>Factious</em>,
the <em>Guilty</em>, and the <em>Disappointed</em>, to censure and malign it, and
will be always liable to Misconstruction, the Reasons of State being
so Mysterious) yet cou'd never charge on him any gross Misbehaviour
in Point of Moral Duty, any one habitual Vice, or indulg'd Passion,
tho' they wanted not Means of prying into his most secret Commerce and
private Correspondence, and nothing, we know, is so quick-sighted as
Malice.</p>

<p><!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p><p>His Devotion to God was regular and constant both in publick and in
private, and that, not cold and formal, but with an ardent Zeal and
enflam'd Affection. In the midst of the perplexing Cares that encompass
a Throne, and with which <em>his</em> Throne was peculiarly beset; he always
found Leisure for the Exercises of Religion: He was never so dazl'd
with the Splendor of an <em>Earthly</em> Crown, as not to prefer before it
a <em>Heavenly</em> and <em>Immortal</em> One: Nor was he ever unmindful of this
important Truth, that as <em>his</em> Subjects were accountable to <em>him</em>;
(tho' in the End they quite inverted that Order) so was he himself to
render an Account of <em>his</em> Actions at a greater Tribunal before the
King of Kings.</p>

<p>In the midst of the highest Plenty, and all the Means of gratifying
a sensual Appetite that <em>Royal Affluence</em> cou'd Administer, he was
remarkably Temperate, Chast and Sober. His Conjugal Affection has
been even imputed as a <em>Crime</em>. He was an inviolable Observer of his
Matrimonial Vow, a Vertue not <em>too common</em> in the World, a very rare
one indeed in <em>Princes</em>. Nor was he less eminent for Clemency and
Justice, and a tender Regard for the Welfare of his Subjects.</p>

<p>And if we consider him in the last Scene of his Life, in his Behaviour
both before, and at the Scaffold; we may observe an admirable
Composition of Christian Meekness, and Royal Grandeur, how under the
extremest Pressures he wou'd never be prevail'd with, to do any thing
<!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>unbecoming either the <em>Christian</em> or the <em>King</em>.</p>

<p>As he had Liv'd, he Died a true Professor of the purest reform'd Faith:
And his Character has this Advantage, even from the <em>reproachful</em>
manner of his Death; that his last Declaration so publickly made in the
Face of the World, was not capable of being denied, or misrepresented.
Whereas had they dispatch'd him by Poyson or Assassination, or any
other way of Murder, that had carried less of Pomp and Ostentation; the
Accusation had been obvious, that he Died a <em>Papist</em>, which his Enemies
would not have fail'd to have reported, and his Friends could not so
convincingly have disprov'd.</p>

<p>His admirable and instructing Legacy to his Children, his Praying for
his Murderers, his patient Resignation to the Will of God, and indeed
all the several Parts of his Deportment at that dismal Juncture; do
conspire to raise in us the highest Esteem and Veneration for his
Memory. And sure we may allow to one who was endu'd with so large a
Share of Vertues, with so inconsiderable a Mixture of Defects, the
Character and Denomination of a good Man. I mean, in a qualified Sense,
for, in an absolute Sense, we know who has told us, there is none good
but God. And this is one Point in which <em>Naboth</em> and he agree.</p>

<p>The next is, that they both were Murder'd with a pretended Show of
Justice, and with Religious Solemnities.</p>

<p><!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p><p>In order to <em>Naboth</em>'s Murder there was a <em>Fast Proclaim'd</em>, <em>a solemn
Assembly call'd</em>, a formal Accusation forg'd, and suborn'd Witnesses
produc'd. The principally intended Wickedness was thus usher'd in
with a preparatory Combination of other Crimes; thus closely was the
Train of Mischeif laid, by the Contrivance of wicked <em>Jezebel</em>; that
<em>Hypocrisy</em>, <em>Perjury</em> and <em>false Judgment</em> should be the Prelude and
Introduction to <em>Murder</em>.</p>

<p>And was not this exactly the Case of our <em>Royal Sufferer</em>? Was there
not a Day of <em>Humiliation</em> appointed? Was not the nefarious Business in
Agitation dignified with the specious Title of <em>the Lord's Work</em>? Did
not the cheif Authors of that Cruelty pretend to be <em>seeking the Lord</em>,
whilst their Instruments were embruing their Hands in the Blood of the
<em>Lord's Anointed</em>.</p>

<p>How horribly did they profane the Name of God, whilst they invok'd
him, as Accessary to their Bloody Machinations, and besought him to
strengthen their Hands in that diabolical Work! How wretchedly did they
pervert his Word, which teaches all Obedience and Reverence to Princes;
whilst even from those sacred Writings they would pretend to justify
not only the highest Insolence and Contempt, but even the actual Murder
of his <em>Lawful Vice-gerent</em>! To how base Purposes were the Ordinances
of Religion prostituted, whilst they fasted for the Success of that
impious Act, which it requires <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>a perpetual Fast to deprecate the Guilt
of: And <em>made long Prayers</em> only <em>for a Pretense</em>, when they were
making a Royal Widow, and devouring Houses and Lands, stately Palaces,
and Princely Revenues with insatiable Greediness! How ill did it accord
with their profest Purity and Godliness, after they had strain'd at so
many Gnats, to swallow such a Camel!</p>

<p>Could they, in Reality, have been held by any Religious Ties, they
would have paid some Regard, if not to the general Precepts of
Obedience, if not to the former Oaths of Allegiance they had taken;
yet at least to their own <em>Solemn League and Covenant</em>, that precious
Test of Disloyalty, they so eagerly contended for, and which they had
contriv'd as a Snare for others, whilst, thro' the Deadness of their
Consciences, they were unrestrain'd themselves.</p>

<p>Even <em>that Engagement</em>, rebellious as it was, provided for the Security
of the King's Person, which they were bound, by all that was Sacred, to
protect and defend; and consequently the putting him to Death, besides
all the other bad Circumstances, was an Act of the most <em>deliberate
Perjury</em> that ever was committed.</p>

<p>But as if something was still wanting to fill up the Measure of their
complicated Impiety; they added Hypocrisy to the rest, gave a Religious
Turn to their execrable Proceedings, and in the Depth of all this
Mischeif, pretended a Zeal for God's Glory, and to have nothing so
<!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>much at Heart, as promoting the Purity of his Worship.</p>

<p>Nor was <em>Piety</em> the only false Pretence, they wou'd make a show of
<em>Justice</em> too: They would seem to do that by <em>Law</em>, which was an open
Violation of all the Laws both of God and Man. To this End was erected
a Mock-Tribunal of Self-created Judges, who by Vertue of that usurp'd
and imaginary Authority, presum'd to set before 'em as a Criminal,
their unquestionably rightful Sovereign. They had false Witnesses,
<em>Sons of Belial</em>, ready at hand to have born their Testimony against
him, and to have charg'd him with such Things, as he not only, in Fact,
was clear of, but which he was not capable of committing.</p>

<p><em>Naboth</em> indeed might, 'tho' he did not, have Curs'd <em>God and the
King</em>. [Note: So the Hebrew Verb should be rendred here, as it is
elsewhere. The <em>Arabick</em> and <em>Chaldee</em> express it by two different
Words. Thou didst <em>Blaspheme</em> God, and <em>Curse</em> the King.] There were
really such Offences, tho' there was no such Offender. Whereas in the
Case of our Martyr'd Prince, the Crime its self was as Fictitious as
the Personal Charge. He not only was not, but cou'd not be guilty of
that Treason they accus'd him of, since by our known Constitution, it
was against himself only that any Treason cou'd be committed. We find
in no Records the mention of such a Crime, as the <em>Lese-Majesty of the
People</em>, nor that the cruellest Tyrants were ever <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>tax'd with being
<em>Rebels</em> to their own Subjects. 'Tis possible for 'em to Misgovern, to
subvert Fundamentals, to abuse their Trust, or to forsake it, and drive
the People to a Necessity of transferring their Allegiance (of which
our own Times have furnish'd us with an Instance:) But they can never
be guilty of <em>Treason</em>, nor suffer the Punishment of <em>Traytors</em>.</p>

<p>When therefore the good King disown'd this illegal Judicature, and
refus'd (as he well might) to Plead his Cause before 'em; they still
went on with a Mask of Justice, and in Mock-Representation of a legal
Process, to Sentence and Condemn him, and Sign a Bloody Warrant for his
Execution.</p>

<p>Another Thing in which his Case does nearly resemble that of <em>Naboth</em>
is, that they both were Murder'd for the same Cause, because they wou'd
not part with the <em>Inheritance of their Fathers</em>.</p>

<p><em>Naboth</em> might have compounded for his <em>Life</em>, by relinquishing
his <em>Vineyard</em>, nay he might have had an equivalent too. But as he
conceiv'd himself bound in Conscience, religiously to preserve his
original Patrimony, he was under an unhappy Necessity of making such a
Refusal, as brought him to that untimely End.</p>

<p>And the Desire of his <em>Inheritance</em> was the Motive that induc'd our
unnatural Country-men, to take away the Life of their Lawful King.
The Inherent-Rights and Prerogtiaves of the <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Crown, which his Royal
Predecessors had uncontestably enjoy'd, thro' a Succession of many
Ages, were one after another disputed with <em>him</em>, and in the End
violently extorted. What he cou'd depart from, with safety to his
Conscience and Honour, he gave 'em, by a voluntary Consent, to preserve
the Quiet of his Kingdom; but when he perceiv'd that nothing wou'd
content 'em; (their Demands still rising, as his Concessions were
larger) he adher'd with a steddy Resolution to those Branches of Power,
which he judg'd to be inseparable from the Royal Dignity, and parted
with them and his Life together.</p>

<p>Before they had thus compass'd their wicked Ends, and were become
Masters of all without Controul, whilst there was yet the Appearance
and Shadow of Kingly Government, and nothing cou'd be valid without
the Royal Sanction; even then, tho' they left him the <em>Name</em>, they
arrogated to themselves the <em>Power</em>. With what repeated Importunities
did they Daily tear from him his most trusted and faithful Servants,
under the Character of <em>Evil Counsellors</em>, and thrust into his Presence
and Councils, their own Mercenary Creatures, Men of notorious Faction
and Disloyalty, the profest Haters both of his Person and Authority,
as the only Men to be <em>confided</em> in! How justly might he have answer'd
their haughty and unreasonable Demands (for such in Effect were their
<em>humble <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Petitions</em>) in the Words of the wisest of Princes (when a
very improper Application was made to him, in behalf of one, who had
so little Pretension to <em>Favour</em>, that <em>Impunity</em> was more than he had
deserv'd) <em>Ask for him the Kingdom also</em>. [Note: <cite>1 Kings</cite> 2. 22.]</p>

<p>They wanted, in short, such a Power as should create Dependencies on
<em>them</em>, and tie fast to their Service such Instruments of Mischeif as
they should have Occasion to make use of. And not to descend to all
the several Branches of Royalty, 'twas Dominion and Government they
aim'd at; an Affectation of Lording and Ruling it, was the real Ground
of their seditious Outcries (as the Event sufficiently show'd) however
they varnish'd over their Designs with more plausible Pretences.</p>

<p>Once more, we may observe another Resemblance between these two
Innocent Persons, in that neither of 'em suffer'd <em>singly</em>, but the
Enemies of each extended their Malice to the <em>whole Race</em> of 'em. Tho'
the History now before us is silent as to <em>Naboth</em>'s <em>Family</em>, and only
relates what befel him in his own <em>Person</em>; yet we may learn from <cite>2
Kings</cite> 9. 26. what became of 'em. <em>Surely I have seen Yesterday the
Blood of <strong>Naboth</strong>, and the Blood of his Sons, saith the Lord, and
I will requite thee in this Plat.</em></p>

<p>It cannot, I confess, be equally affirm'd, with relation to our
Martyr'd Sovereign, that the Blood of <em>his Sons</em> too calls for
Vengeance, <em>that</em> only Stream of Royal Blood having been Spilt, <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>that
ran within his own Veins. But tho' they escap'd with Life, (no Thanks
to the Usurpers of their Inheritance that they did so) yet were they
devested of their just Rights, which none of 'em had then done any
thing to forfeit, driven into Exile, branded with Names of Infamy and
Reproach, and declar'd <em>Traytors</em> and <em>Rebels</em> themselves, as well as
their Abettors and Adherents.</p>

<p>Having said thus much by way of Parallel, give me leave to conclude
the Comparison between these two Innocents, as I first introduc'd it,
with taking Notice of one other material Difference between the two
Histories. <em>Naboth</em>'s Murderer, tho' <em>above</em> the Reach of <em>human</em>
Justice, saw, and confess'd, and bewail'd his Guilt, and humbled
himself so effectually before God, that the Vengeance he requir'd for
that <em>innocent Blood</em> (for <em>innocent Blood</em> will be aveng'd, nor is it
any Security to us, that it was not shed by <em>us</em>, or in <em>our Days</em>) was
not immediately taken, but postpon'd till another Generation.</p>

<p>But the <em>Royal Murderers</em> show'd <em>no</em> Remorse. The <em>Regicides</em> of
<em>this Day</em> continu'd to the last Inflexible and Obdurate: Their Hearts
were so hardned by the just Judgment of God for their accumulated
Wickedness; that even those of 'em who, by his peculiar Providence,
were reserv'd for <em>publick Justice</em>, were so far from any <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Signs of
Repentance, that they even <em>Gloried</em> in the inhuman Deed. I come now in
the</p>


<p class="section">II. Place to consider the <em>Nature and Consequences</em> of the Fact
committed on this Day. The <em>Nature</em> of it may be in a great Measure
judg'd, from what has been already said. But farther to convince us
of the enormous Guilt of it, let us take it, as attended with the
following Circumstances.</p>

<p>For a Sovereign and <em>Hereditary Monarch</em> (it was then an <em>Hereditary
Monarchy</em> sure) after many other previous Outrages and Affronts, to
be brought to the Bar, as a <em>common Malefactor</em>, and that before a
pretended <em>High-Court</em> compos'd of his own <em>Subjects</em>, surrounded with
a Guard of his own <em>Soldiers</em>, to be Arraign'd of <em>Treason</em>, to be
Sentenc'd to <em>Death</em>, and Executed on a <em>Scaffold</em>, in his <em>Capital
City</em>, and before the Walls of his own <em>Palace</em>: And all this to
gratify the Ambition or Revenge of a few turbulent Spirits, whilst a
far greater Number, who disapprov'd of that rigorous Extremity, cou'd
yet be contented to stand by as unconcern'd Spectators, and suffer the
bloody Tragedy to be Acted, without offering to interpose, or stirring
to the Rescue of their Prince: The Fact I say thus circumstantiated, is
not to be equal'd in any History, by which Majesty its self, as well as
the Person of the King, was so outragiously insulted.</p>

<p><!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p><p>And that all this should be done in a Kingdom, <em>by the undoubted
and fundamental Laws</em> whereof (I speak in the very Words of a Law,
made indeed since the horrid Fact, but made, not to constitute, but
recognize this <em>Essential Prerogative</em>, as antecedently inherent in
the Crown, that) <em>neither the Peers of the Realm, nor the Commons, nor
both together, in Parliament, or out of Parliament, nor the People
Collectively, nor Representatively, nor any other Persons whatsoever,
ever had, have, or ought to have any coercive Power over the Persons of
the Kings of the Realm</em>. [Note: Stat. 12. <cite>Car.</cite> 2. Ch. 30. §. 7.]</p>

<p>And if no such Authority was lodg'd with the <em>whole Body</em> of Subjects,
how much less cou'd it be claim'd by that <em>inconsiderable Remnant</em> of
one House, which without the Concurrence of the other, and whilst the
far greater Part of its own Members were kept out by Force of Arms; had
the Confidence to usurp the venerable Name of <em>Parliament</em>.</p>

<p>Never was that <em>happy Part</em> of our <em>Constitution</em>, that <em>Necessary
Fence</em> against <em>Arbitrary Rule</em>, and Bulwark of English Laws and
Liberties, so reproachfully perverted. Never were the People of
<em>England</em> so untruly said to be represented: which they no more were,
by the corrupt Refuse of that Assembly; than the <em>Catholic Church</em> was
fairly represented in the pretended <em>Council</em> of <em>Trent</em>, where only
those cou'd be admitted, who were the known Favorers of the <em>Pope's
Supremacy</em>, and who wou'd be sure to do his Work effectually.</p>

<p><!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p><p>But let us suppose they had a Power over his Person, and withal that
he had misemploy'd his Regal Administration as much as some have
represented him to have done; let us take all for Truth that inveterate
Malice, or factious Prejudice has endeavour'd to fasten on him; even
these Provocations were far from sufficient to justify so extravagant a
Remedy as the shedding of his Blood.</p>

<p>Much less when they liv'd under so mild a Government, and a Prince so
tender of the Rights and Liberties of his Subjects as he naturally was
in his own Temper.</p>

<p>I pretend not to deny that, even in <em>his</em> Reign, there were some
just Causes of Complaint, some real Grievances, some unwarrantable
Impositions and unjustifiable Demands. Princes are but Men, and
fallible like other Men, nor is it any great Wonder if the best of 'em
mistake the Extent of their Prerogative, when persuaded into an undue
Opinion of it, by those that shou'd advise 'em better.</p>

<p>But how easily might those Greivances have been set right in Time, had
not the rough and undutiful Manner in which the Redress of 'em was
sought, made him believe for a time there were none that needed it.
But when once he was convinc'd of their Reality, how willingly did he
redress 'em all, and more than all, that cou'd with any show of Justice
be complain'd of, or be thought to deserve the Name of <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Hardships!
How often might Things have been brought to a better Temper, and the
unhappy Breach accommodated, had not their own Obstinacy prevented
it, whom no Degree of Royal Condescension would satisfie or appease;
but his Blood they <em>would have</em>, and his Blood they <em>had</em>: The Guilt
whereof has ever since lay heavy on this sinful Nation, and even now
calls for our deepest Humiliation, to deprecate that Vengeance of
Almighty God, which might justly be inflicted on the <em>remote Posterity</em>
of the Actors in that <em>unnatural Parricide</em>.</p>

<p>He has abundantly testified his Displeasure at it, by many bad and
mischeivous <em>Consequences</em> it has produc'd, some of which we still
smart under, tho' not the first I am going to mention, which is</p>

<p>The Confusion of those Times that immediately ensu'd. The miserable
State of <em>Anarchy</em> to which this unhappy Country was reduc'd, after
the Extirpation of the <em>Royal Family</em>, may be a Warning to all
querulous Innovators, who are never contented with the present State
of Things. They compass'd their Wish at last, and had the Satisfaction
of seeing both <em>Kingly and Episcopal Government</em> at once abolish'd,
and themselves, (as they suppos'd) in a State of <em>religious and civil
Liberty</em>.</p>

<p>But did they enjoy that <em>Liberty</em> any otherwise than in Name? Did
it not cost 'em much dearer to maintain their <em>new Lords</em> in their
<!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>ill-gotten <em>Tyranny</em>, than ever it had done to supply the Exigencies
of their <em>lawful Prince</em>? Was the Freedom of <em>Parliament</em>, and Right
of <em>Elections</em> more inviolably kept? Were they less under the Terror
of an <em>armed Force</em>? Were there fewer <em>Executions</em>, <em>Fines</em> and
<em>Imprisonments</em>? Was the Course of the <em>Law</em> more free and undisturb'd,
or <em>Justice</em> more equitably and impartially Administer'd? Were the
<em>Taxes</em> more moderate, the <em>Loans</em> of Money less constrain'd, or the
<em>Public Faith</em> (when no Body knew what or where the <em>Public</em> was) a
better Security for what was lent, than before this violent Convulsion
of the State.</p>

<p>No. The Reverse of all this is notoriously true, if there be any Truth
in History. They dream't and rav'd of Oppression before, but they were
then opprest in Earnest. They were before chastis'd with imaginary
Whips, but then with real Scorpions. And surely it was a just Judgment
of God upon 'em for their Inconstancy of Temper, and Eagerness for a
Change, that when once they had shaken off their just Allegiance, and
chose new Masters for themselves, they were afterwards forc'd to be
perpetually changing, and cou'd find no Power that was able to protect
'em long, but saw more Turns and Revolutions in the Compass of a few
Months, than had happen'd in a Thousand Years before.</p>

<p><!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p><p>New Schemes and Models of Government were daily Fashion'd, some of
which died in <em>Embryo</em>, others made a Blaze for a short Time, but no
sooner had they turn'd themselves to the new-started Light, in hopes to
be warm'd and directed by it, but the Airy Meteor disappear'd.</p>

<p>'Twas a common Thing then to see Servants on Horseback, whilst Princes
walk'd on Foot, to see the meanest of the People in the highest
Places; and one might have seen <em>Jotham</em>'s Parable exactly verified,
when instead of the <em>Fatness of the Olive</em>, and the <em>Fruitfulness of
the Vine</em>; the Supreme Dominion was invested in the despicable, the
useless, the hurtful <em>Brambles</em>.</p>

<p>Then as to <em>Spirituals</em>. Did the <em>Authors</em> of those Troubles find their
Account in 'em? Were they able at last quietly to Establish their own
Way of Worship, and had they not many contending Rivals? Were not
their own Complaints against the Hierarchy, of <em>taking too much upon
'em</em>, <em>imposing</em> on the <em>Lord's People</em>, and depriving 'em of their
<em>Christian Liberty</em>, return'd upon themselves? Was there a greater
Advancement of Piety, whilst the <em>Sacrament</em> was rarely Administer'd,
the Catechizing of Youth exceedingly neglected, and almost all Religion
resolv'd into <em>Hearing</em>? Was there a greater <em>Liberty of Conscience</em>,
when the prevailing Sect for the Time Condemn'd the <em>Toleration</em> of the
rest as <em>Anti-christian</em>?</p>

</div>

<p><em>These</em> were the <em>Blessed</em> Fruits of <em>Discord</em> and <em>Rebellion</em>.
<em>This</em> was the Price of over-turning a legally and peacably settled
Constitution.</p>

<p>As another bad Effect (but God be prais'd that's over too) of this
Day's Cruelty, may be reckon'd the imminent Danger we were in, not many
Years since, of the Return of <em>Popish Superstition</em> into this Nation,
to which, in all human Probability, the greatest Part of it had in a
little time relaps'd, had not Providence defeated the Designs that were
form'd against our Holy Religion, by the late <em>Happy Revolution</em>.</p>

<p>That very Danger, I say, of <em>Popery</em>, may be imputed, in its Original,
to those who, by Banishing the <em>Royal Progeny</em>, and obliging 'em to
fly for shelter to the Court of a <em>Popish Prince</em>, expos'd 'em to the
utmost Temptation of changing the Religion of the Country they had
left, for that of the Place where they were Entertain'd. It did, in
Fact, so happen, that they were earnestly solicited to that Effect, and
one of 'em, we know, (and we had like to have known it at too dear a
Rate) unhappily complied with the Temptation.</p>

<p><!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p><p>But there are some ill Consequences of that great Rebellion, that still
affect us, and particularly the unhappy Divisions that reign among us.
'Tis a sad and deplorable Thing indeed, that Men who are Professors of
the same Religion, who have the same Political Obligations, who are
bound by all the Ties both of Interest and Duty to direct their Designs
and Actions to the same End, should notwithstanding, fly into such
opposite Extremes, and brand each other with such opprobrious Names.</p>

<p>Such Jealousies and Surmises, such <em>Names of Distinction</em>, and forming
of <em>Parties</em>, were the fatal Beginnings of that <em>Intestine War</em>, which
depopulated and laid Wast this flourishing Kingdom, and ended in the
<em>Murder</em> of the <em>Sovereign</em>, and the total overthrow of all orderly
Government both in Church and State. And that Spirit of Division which
then began to Reign has never since been totally ejected.</p>

<p>Add to this, that many loose Principles as to <em>Government</em>, were then
imbib'd, of which it were much to be wish'd, there were no Tincture
still remaining.</p>

<p>And (which is worst of all) it is too certain that the Pretences to
a more than ordinary Sanctity, and the great Apperance of Godliness
in such Numbers of Men, who yet, when the Mask was off, were found to
be wicked to the last Degree, and to have acted by no Principles <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>but
<em>Iuterest</em> and <em>Ambition</em>; gave an unhappy Disgust to many Observers
of their Conduct, against all that favor'd of Piety and Goodness, and
rais'd an unjust suspicion in 'em, that all Religion was counterfeit,
that whoever went under the Character of a <em>devout Person</em>, was only
acting a Part, in order to deceive. Thus were the Seeds of <em>Atheism</em>
and <em>Irreligion</em> sown, which have since thriven but too well, and
yielded a very ungracious Encrease.</p>

<p>1. To the same Cause too we may ascribe almost all our Differences in
Religion. We can call upon all the Persuasions but one, who enjoy the
Benefit of the <em>Toleration</em>, (and may it ever be enjoy'd by Consciences
truly tender) to look back to those unhappy Times for their first
Original, and see, in the midst of how much Licenciousness and Disorder
they were propagated, and began to spread.</p>

<p>I shall only crave your farther Patience, while I apply what has been
said in two short moral Reflections, both which I shall take from the
concluding Prayer in the Service for the Day, where we beseech God,
<em>that neither the splendor of any thing that is great, nor the Conceit
of any thing that is good in us, may any ways withdraw our Eyes from
looking on our selves as sinful Dust and Ashes</em>.</p>

<p>1. Then, from the tragical Event of this Day, we may observe the
<em>Uncertainty</em> of all <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><em>Human State and Grandeur</em>. Of how short
Continuance, and consequently of how little Value is the most
glittering Pomp, that attracts our vain Eyes, and strikes us with
Admiration! Of how slippery a Tenure must <em>lesser</em> Dignities and
Honours be, if <em>Majesty</em> it self be so insecure! How little is the
Condition of Princes to be envied, who have often Occasion to envy
the Quiet and Repose of the meanest of their Subjects, who can Sleep
securely, whilst <em>they</em> are waking and caring for 'em! They are equally
expos'd to Pain and Sickness, to Infirmity and Diseases; they lye as
open to a natural, and much <em>more</em> open to a violent Death. <em>Plots</em>
and <em>Conspiracies</em>, <em>Assassinations</em> and <em>Poysonings</em> are Accidents
peculiar to the <em>Royal List</em> of Mortality, and seldom bring a Subject
to his End.</p>

<p>Nor is the <em>Fame</em> of Princes less liable to Injury, than their
<em>Persons</em>. Calumny dares even assault the <em>Throne</em>, and fears not to
trample on <em>Regal Sepulchers</em>. There is none so great and inaccessible,
as to be out of the Reach of that intruding Monster; who will blacken
and sully the clearest Fame, turn the brightest Ornaments and Beauties
into Deformities, detract from the most Heroical and Princely Vertues,
and transform, to the Appearance of such as see by her Glass, a
good <em>Josiah</em> into a wicked <em>Jeroboam</em>. And as the most conspicuous
<em>Greatness</em> is no <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Preservative against the common Calamities of the
World, so neither</p>

<p>2. Is the most eminent <em>Goodness</em>. Tryals and Afflictions are the
common Lot of Mortality, and every Man, more or less must sustain his
Share of 'em. In this, the Righteous and Wicked fare alike, nor can a
Man judge of Love or Hatred by all that is before him.</p>

<p>There are indeed many Passages of Scripture, that encourage a good Man
to expect even the Blessings of this Life, and ordinarily Speaking,
he does actually enjoy 'em, at least in a contented Mind and quiet
Conscience, which comprehends 'em all. But we are to look upon these
Passages, as moral Observations, not as absolute Promises: That
according to the most rational, most probable, most natural Event,
such temporal Blessings would be allotted to good Men, not that each
particular good Man should be possess'd of every one of 'em, for that
would be in some Measure, to have his Portion here.</p>

<p>All this is beside our Contract with God. The Reward there stipulated,
is the <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em>, and if he does think fit to <em>add these
Things unto us</em>, and to enlarge our Portion, by the Accession of some
external good Things, 'tis over and above our covenanted Recompence.</p>

<p><!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p><p>But whatever the Lot may be of a righteous Man here on <em>Earth</em>, he
will be sure of his Reward in a <em>better Place</em>, in those Regions of
endless Bliss and Glory, where the <em>Blessed Martyr</em>, whom we this Day
Commemorate, we may Charitably presume, is now adorn'd with that <em>Crown
of Life</em>, which he Purchas'd by his constant <em>Perseverance unto Death</em>.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
